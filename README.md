##  AI Voice Assistant – Python

**AI Voice Assistant** is a Python-based interactive application that listens to your speech, understands it using AI, and responds with natural-sounding speech in real time.  

It uses the following core components:
- **RealtimeSTT** – Converts your speech into text instantly.
- **Cohere API** – A large language model (LLM) that understands your request and generates an intelligent response.
- **RealtimeTTS** – Converts the AI's text response into human-like audio so you can hear it.

##  How It Works

1. **Speech to Text (RealtimeSTT)**  
   The microphone captures your voice and transcribes it into text in real time using **RealtimeSTT** (Speech-to-Text).  

2. **AI Response Generation (Cohere API)**  
   The transcribed text is sent to **Cohere**, a cloud-based AI platform that provides **large language models (LLMs)**.  
   - LLMs are advanced AI models trained on massive amounts of text to understand and generate human-like responses.
   - Cohere processes the input, understands the context, and produces a meaningful reply.  

3. **Text to Speech (RealtimeTTS)**  
   The AI's text reply is fed into **RealtimeTTS** (Text-to-Speech), which converts it into clear, natural-sounding audio you can hear instantly.
